        <p>Gary Vaynerchuk is the chairman of VaynerX, a modern-day media and communications holding company, 
            and the active CEO of VaynerMedia, a full-service advertising agency servicing Fortune 100 clients 
            across the company’s 4 locations.
            In the late 90s, after identifying “the internet” 
            as a land-grab opportunity, Gary transitioned his father’s local liquor store into one of the 
            first wine e-commerce platforms resulting in growing the family business from $3-60MM in sales 
            during a 5-year period.
